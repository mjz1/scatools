\arguments{
\item{sce}{A \code{SingleCellExperiment} object}

\item{assay_name}{Name of the assay to segment}

\item{new_assay}{Name of the new assay}

\item{alpha}{significance levels for the test to accept change-points.}

\item{nperm}{number of permutations used for p-value computation.}

\item{min.width}{the minimum number of markers for a changed segment.
    The default is 2 but can be made larger.  Maximum possible value is
    set at 5 since arbitrary widths can have the undesirable effect of
    incorrect change-points when a true signal of narrow widths exists.}

\item{undo.splits}{A character string specifying how change-points are
    to be undone, if at all.  Default is "none".  Other choices are
    "prune", which uses a sum of squares criterion, and "sdundo", which 
    undoes splits that are not at least this many SDs apart.}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity}

\item{ncores}{Number of cores to use}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to pass to \link[DNAcopy:segment]{DNAcopy::segment}}
