\arguments{
\item{sce}{SingleCellExperiment Object}

\item{assay_name}{Name of assay from which to calculate metrics from. It is highly recommended that these are segmented and merged data.}

\item{group_by}{Name of column containing the grouping information}

\item{method}{One of \code{gmm} or \code{min_sd}}

\item{n_normal_clusts}{Number of expected normal clusters (only for method \code{min_sd})}

\item{plot}{Plot cluster scores and tumor/normal identifications}

\item{use_cnv_score}{Also use CNV score (absolute mean of the assay)}
}
\value{
SingleCellExperiment object with column \code{tumor_cell}
}
\description{
Uses the standard deviation of the difference between each bin to estimate tumor and normal cell clusters. Using method \code{gmm} will calculate the per cluster median of the sd, and then fit a two-component GMM to determine tumor cells. If method \code{min_sd} is specified (or if only two clusters are provided), simply uses the \code{n_normal_clusts} with the lowest median sd.
